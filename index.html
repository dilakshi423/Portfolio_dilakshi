										During my internship at SLT, I had the opportunity to work on a significant project that involved creating a backend application using PHP for an Android app. This experience had a profound impact on my personal and professional growth.<br/>
										
										Working on the development of the backend service allowed me to acquire valuable skills in languages such as PHP, CSS, HTML, and even Golang. I gained hands-on experience in building robust and efficient systems while also 
										delving into the fundamentals of microservice architecture.   <br/><br/>

										Approaching problem-solving during this project involved breaking down complex issues into smaller components. This approach enabled me to tackle each challenge systematically and find effective solutions. I also engaged in research to deepen 
										my understanding of specific concepts and technologies whenever necessary.  <br/><br/>

										One pivotal realization I had during my internship was the importance of continuous learning and adaptability. Each day presented new problems and hurdles to overcome, making it clear that staying updated with the latest technologies and industry trends is crucial to 
										thrive in the field of Information Technology. <br/><br/>

										Moving forward, I am committed to sharpening my skills in every possible area. I will continue to explore new technologies, expand my knowledge base, and remain adaptable to the dynamic nature of the industry. By doing so, I aim to become a
										 proficient developer capable of creating innovative and impactful solutions <br/>
